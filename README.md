### Hi there 👋

I'm a developer living in Tokyo Japan.


🚀 Building/working on: 
- JavaScript design pattern [snippets](https://github.com/hype08/JS-design-pattern-snippets) for  VSCode.
- A [movie_rec app](https://github.com/hype08/movie_recs) with React.js, Redux, and Styled Components.

<!--
**hype08/hype08** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
